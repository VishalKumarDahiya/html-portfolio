<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kashmir Files</h3>
<p>This is one the best movie I ever watched and cried after seeing the truth of genocide of Kashmiri Hindus</p>
<h3>Kerala Stories</h3>
<p>This movie shows the conspiracy against the hindus and other by Islamic radicals. This is based on true stories</p>
<h3>Peaceful Warrior</h3>
<p>This is really a philosophical movie which teaches about the life and changes our attitude towards the life</p>
